This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked issue in R: the silent dropping of non-existent columns when subsetting data frames using character vectors.  The `bug.r` file contains code that exhibits this problem.  The `bugSolution.r` file offers solutions to avoid this behavior and ensure robust code.
